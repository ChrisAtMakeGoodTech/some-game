# Combat

## The Field

The encounter map will be either rigidly or loosely divided into Zones. Units (Characters and Objects on the encounter map) are defined to be *somewhere* in their Zone. Units are considered to be in melee range of everyone and everything in their Zone and are considered to have unobstructed access to everyone and everything, with the exception of abilities like Cover. Characters can interact with anything in their Zone without expending movement. Moving to an adjacent Zone requires one unit of movement. Moving farther than an adjacent Zone generally requires the character to use their entire action for movement.

In the case of fixed Zones, they will be determined ahead of time by the GM and will be clearly indicated to the players.

When a map uses loosely divided Zones, a Zone has a radius of around 10 feet. Units that are more than 10 feet away but less than around 30 feet are considered to be in an adjacent Zone.

## Challenge Score

Each map or Zone will have a Challenge Score declared. This indicates the general difficulty of the map or Zone. Actions that don't target a unit or that target a unit without its own Action Score will generally use the Challenge Score as their target for the d20 roll, possibly with modifiers.

## Setting Up an Encounter

1. The GM will set up the map and place any NPC's and objects.
2. The GM will work with the players to determine their locations at the beginning of the encounter.
3. The GM will set a Challenge Score for the encounter.
4. The GM may decide to use fluid Zones, fixed Zones, or a combination of the two. For example, the area around a ship's helm may be defined as a fixed Zone, while the rest of the deck is divided into fluid Zones based on the where the units are and what they're doing.
5. The GM may define Challenge Scores for any or all of the map's Zones. When a Zone's Challenge Score is not defined, the map's Challenge Score is generally used.
6. The GM may also define specific Challenge Scores for Objects and Hazards on the map.
7. The GM may define Action Scores for NPC's. These Action Scores can change at any time at the GM's discretion. When an Action Score is not defined, the NPC's generally uses the Challenge Score of the Zone or map.

## Round Flow
1. The GM states what every NPC intends to do (or *seems* to intend to do).
2. The GM may choose to modify any Action and Challenge Scores.
3. All players state what they intend to do.
4. Every player determines their Action Score by rolling a d20 and adding modifiers (attributes, action modifiers, and any situational bonuses or penalties.)
5. The GM resolves the actions of the round based on intended actions and Action Scores. All actions happen virtually simultaneously. In the event of conflicts where two opposing actions can't both happen (e.g., a hero and villain racing to grab a treasured artifact from its pedestal), the one with the highest Action Score for the round wins.

## Standard Combat Actions

| Move and Attack | 0 | Move 1 then Basic Attack; *or* Basic Attack then Move 1 |
| Standing Attack | +3 | Basic Attack |

| Tend | 0 | The Target can use your Action Score for their Recover roll. | Target must be Incapacitated.

## NPC Classes

There are three main classes of NPC in an encounter that differ in how they take damage.

|Class|Health|Displayed Health|
|--|--|--|
|Peon|Defeated by any Glancing Hit or Full Hit.|1/1|
|Grunt|Killed by two Glancing Hits or one Full Hit.|2/2, 1/2 after receiving a Glancing Hit.|
|Foe|Have normal current and max health like a PC. PC's must roll damage.|Health bar is shown without numbers.|

## Attacking and Damage

When attacking a Target, the Attacker's Action Score is compared to the Target's. If the Attacker's score meets or exceeds the Target's, the Attacker scores a Full Hit. This does full damage (2d6 for a Basic Attack) and will apply any additional effects of special abilities. If the Target's Action score beats the Attacker's, the Attacker scores a Glancing Hit. This generally does reduced damage (1d6 for a Basic Attack) and doesn't trigger any additional effects. If the Target's Action Score exceeds the Attacker's by 10 or more, the attack is a full Miss and has no effect.

Example: Splinter and the Shredder are squaring off in a climactic battle for the fate of New York City and the world. They both attack each other. The GM determines that the Shredder's Action Score is 18. Splinter rolls a d20 and adds modifiers to determine his Action Score for the round.

|Splinter's Action Score|Splinter's Attack Result|Shredder's Attack Result|Shredder's Action Score
|--|--|--|--|
|8|Miss|Full Hit|18|
|9|Glancing Hit|Full Hit|18|
|18|Full Hit|Full Hit|18|
|19|Full Hit|Glancing Hit|18|
|28|Full Hit|Miss|18|

## Skill Challenges

Characters may need to leap a chasm, move a heavy object, compete in an archery contest, or other demonstrations of skill. There are two types of such challenges.

A **Feat of Skill** is a challenge in which the character generally passes or fails. The GM will set a Challenge Score, the character will roll a d20 and add any modifiers, and the two numbers will be compared. Partial successes are possible, and a failure may mean simply trying again. Previous attempts generally don't affect the results of the next attempt. Examples include leaping a raging river and passing oneself off as a different person.

A **Feat of Effort** is a challenge in which the character works toward a result over several attempts. The GM will set a Challenge Score and a Progress Goal. The character will roll a d20 and add any modifiers. The result of their roll determines what dice they use for their progress roll, if any. The result of their progress roll is added to their progress total. Subsequent attempts add to their progress total until they meet or exceed their Progress Goal.

### Skill Challenge Example: In the Nick of Spine

Hercules and Dr. Jones are trapped in a room with a wall of deadly spines slowly sliding closer. The GM sets a Timer. The party has six turns to escape or they'll die as pincushions. Dr. Jones realizes the writing over the three torchlit idols may hold the clue to their escape, but he only has a few rounds to decipher the message and avoid a spikey death.

Deciphering the text is a Feat of Effort with a Challenge Score is 14 and a Progress Goal of 10. Dr. Jones is an expert in indigenous languages so he gets a +4. The GM thinks he should take an additional -2 penalty because it's hard to focus in the face of violent acupuncture, but the player makes the case that Dr. Jones has been in worse situations and that he's very focused under pressure, so the GM decides to actually give him an extra +1 for a total bonus of +5.

1. Dr. Jones rolls 12 for a modified 17. He rolls 2d6 for progress and gets 7.
2. Dr. Jones rolls 6 for a modified 11. He rolls 1d6 for progress and get 2 for a cumulative 9. So close!
3. Dr. Jones rolls 15 for a modified 20. He rolls 2d6 for progress and get 10 for a cumulative 19. He knows what the message says!

Dr. Jones quickly instructs Hercules to rearrange the idols a certain order. Moving the heavy stone idols would normally require a Feat of Skill, but the GM decides it's a simple task for Hercules' godly might and doesn't require a roll. Still, it takes the mighty hero several turns to move them all into place. With one round left, an exit opens in the floor and the heroes narrowly escape a gruesome death -- for now.
