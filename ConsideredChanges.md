# Considered Changes

## Combine Defend and Recover (conscious)

### Changed

| Action | Bonus | Effect | Restrictions |
|--|--|--|--|
| *Defend (old)* | +2 | Glancing Hits against you become Misses. |
| *Recover (removed)* | +2 | Spend a Healing Surge to recover d10. On a 9 or 10, also recover one Ardor. | Must be conscious.
|--|--|--|--|
| **Defend (changed)** | +2 | Glancing Hits against you become Misses. You can choose to use a Healing Surge to recover 1d10 health. On a 10, also recover one Ardor. |

### Reason
I'm low on health and surrounded by enemies. If I Defend, I'll still be low health. If I Recover, I'm likely to take more damage than I recover. I could roll a 1 on my healing surge.

### Alternatives

As above, but change healing surge to d6, d8, or 2d4.

d10 may be too strong if you're also getting the effect of Defend. You could also still roll a 1 on your healing surge. Healing for 1 may not feel like a wasted turn since you still get the effects of Defend, but it may feel like a waste of a healing surge.

## Improved Cover

| Action | Bonus | Effect | Restrictions |
|--|--|--|--|
| *Cover (old)* | +5 | Defend a Target. The Target can use your Action Score for defense. | Must be near target to defend from melee attacks. Must be between target and attacker to defend from ranged attacks.
|--|--|--|--|
| **Cover (changed)** | +5 | Defend a Target. The Target can use your Action Score for defense. When the target takes damage from a full hit on this turn, you can redirect half of that damage to yourself. | Must be near target to defend from melee attacks. To defend from ranged attacks, must be between target and attacker OR near target OR near attacker. |

### Reason

Rarely used. Feels like a waste if you roll lower than your target.

## Improved Prepare

| Action | Bonus | Effect
|--|--|--|
| *Prepare (old)* | 0 | +3 Action Score in the next round.
|--|--|--|
| **Prepare (alternative)** | 0 | Gain a d4 preparation die. After you roll *any* die (including damage rolls), you may choose to roll the preparation die and add its value to your roll. You lose your preparation die after using it or at the end of the encounter. You may only have one preparation die at a time.
| **Prepare (alternative)** | 0 | In the next round, Move 1 and gain +3 Action Score. Using this movement does *not* make you lose the Standing Attack bonus.
| **Prepare (alternative)** | 0 | +3 Action Score in the next round. Have an Inspired Moment on a roll of 19 or 20.
| **Prepare (alternative)** | 0 | Add 2d4 to your Action Score in the next round.

### Reason

You're basically giving up a complete action for +3 on the next action. While performing Prepare for a round, the conditions of the encounter may change in such a way that you can't do what you wanted to on the next turn. Your roll could be a full hit even without the Prepare bonus, making it essentially wasted.

### Counter-argument

Prepare can already be powerful if you plan on using Ardor in the next round or if you roll an Inspired Moment.
