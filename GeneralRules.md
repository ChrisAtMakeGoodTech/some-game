# General Game Rules

## Definitions
**Action Score:** This number is a character's overall effectiveness for a round. It a combination of Initiative, Accuracy, and Evasion. For PC's, this is calculated by rolling a d20 and adding modifiers. For NPC's, this is calculated by taking a base Action Score for the NPC determined by the GM and adding modifiers.

**Challenge Score:** This number is an estimate of the difficulty of an encounter or zone. This is the target for doing things like moving through an area undetected or recovering from being Incapacitated.

**Full Hit:** Normally occurs when an attacker's Action Score meets or beats the target's. The attack is fully effective and does full damage. For a basic attack, this is 2d6 damage. Special abilities may do different damage or cause other effects.

**Glancing Hit:** Normally occurs when an attacker's Action Score is less than the targets. The attack is partially effective and may do reduced damage or not trigger certain effects. For a basic attack, this is 1d6 damage.

**Miss:** Normally occurs when a defender's Action Score beats the attacker's by 10 or more. (Attacker with 3 would fully miss a defender with 13.) This usually means the ability is completely ineffective.

**Arduous Action:** Spend one Ardor to take a second action on the same turn. This action can be a special ability.

**Inspired Moment:** A roll of natural 20 indicates a moment of ultimate luck, preparation, and inspiration. The PC's attacks are automatically Full Hits. All attacks against the PC automatically Miss. The PC can take an Arduous Action for free. The GM may also decide that the PC discovers a new variation of a special ability or even a completely new special ability. If the PC has enough XP, the player can choose to spend XP to immediately learn the new ability. Otherwise, they can spend XP during an Extended Rest to train the new ability.

**Fumble:** In *certain* situations, failing to meet certain Action Score targets may indicate a Fumble. For example, a Fumble while fighting in a crowded tavern may mean your attack hits an innocent bystander. A Fumble while crossing the deck of a storm-tossed ship may mean a character is thrown off their feet. The GM determines which situations offer the opportunity for Fumbles and what rolls are low enough to cause a Fumble. *See also **Careful Action***

**Careful Action:** In situations where a Fumble is possible, the GM may offer players the option to perform actions carefully. This gives a penalty to their Action Score but reduces or eliminates the chance for a Fumble.

## Health

**Health:** These go down when you take damage. When they reach zero, you are Incapacitated.

**Incapacitated:** When a PC becomes Incapacitated, they gain one Trauma. They must roll a d4 to determine how many rounds they have before they gain an additional Trauma. Every time the timer runs out, they must gain one Trauma and roll a new d4 to start a new timer. The only action they can take is Recover.

**Trauma:** Increases by one every time the PC is incapacitated or their Incapacited Timer reaches zero. Each point of Trauma is -1 to all d20 rolls. Trauma can only be reduced during an Extended Rest.

## Rests and Breaks

**Break:** Recover Ardor. This occurs any time the PC's have a chance to catch their breath after a dangerous encounter, and generally only takes a few minutes. It can happen even while exploring or solving puzzles as long as they aren't doing anything strenuous. A PC can fully recover their HP during a Break by using a Healing Kit.

**Standard Rest:** Gain the benefits of a Break and regain all Healing Surges. This occurs when the PC's have time to eat, sleep, and tend wounds.

**Extended Rest:** Gain the benefits of a Standard Rest. You may also have the chance to recover Trauma, spend XP, and work on strongholds and long-term goals. This takes several days and cannot happen when the party is in the middle of an adventure with pressing concerns. (It's hard to relax when the kingdom is days from invasion by dragon riders.) This must also occur in an environment the PC considers comfortable. A ranger may be able to have an Extended Rest camping under the stars deep in the forest, but a bookish wizard may come back needing a vacation from her vacation.

### Resting Rules of Thumb

| Event | Recovery | Optional Recovery |
|--|--|--|
| After each encounter | Ardor. | HP by expending Healing Kit. |
| At the beginning of each adventuring day | Ardor, HP, Healing Surges. | |
| Between adventures | Ardor, HP, and Healing Surges. | Trauma, spend XP, and work on strongholds and long-term goals. |
